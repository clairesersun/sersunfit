  SITEMAP.XML - Claire Sersun Fitness
  ============================================

  Helps search engines discover and index pages.
  Update <lastmod> dates when content changes.

  SPA SEO STRATEGY:
  ================
  This is a single-page application (SPA) with hash-based navigation.
  Hash fragments (e.g., #about) are NOT crawled as separate pages by
  most search engines (they are ignored during indexing).

  IMPLICATIONS:
  - Only the homepage URL is truly indexable
  - All hash-based "pages" (#about, #coaching, etc.) are treated as one page
  - This is standard SPA behavior and acceptable for this site's goals

  LONG-TERM SEO STRATEGY:
  - Blog posts will be the primary SEO drivers
  - When blog functionality is expanded, each post should have a unique URL
  - Structured data in index.html provides rich snippets
  - Social meta tags enable good sharing previews

  ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES (not implemented):
  - Server-side rendering (SSR) for true multi-page indexing
  - Pre-rendering/static generation
  - History API-based routing (requires server configuration)

  For now, hash URLs are kept in sitemap as documentation of site structure,
  though search engines will effectively treat this as a single-page site.

    Writing/Blog Page
    When blog posts are added, each post should ideally have its own
    unique URL entry for proper indexing. For now, the writing section
    is empty and this entry serves as a placeholder.
